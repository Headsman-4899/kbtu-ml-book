    "# Evaluation and Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether logistic regression models are useful for making predictions, it is essential to assess their performance. In logistic regression, evaluation and comparison entail determining how well the model performs as well as contrasting various models or variants of the same model. The following are typical techniques for assessing and contrasting logistic regression models:\n",

    "### Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular metric for balanced datasets, accuracy quantifies the percentage of correctly classified instances.\n",
    "\n",

    "F1 score, recall, and precision offer additional information for unbalanced datasets. They have the following definition:\n",
